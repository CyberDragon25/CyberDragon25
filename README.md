### Hi there 👋 I’m Subham

I’m a Computer Science graduate from **Iowa State University** with a minor in Data Science, currently seeking **New Grad Software Engineer** roles.

I enjoy building reliable, well-designed software across **systems, backend, mobile, and web**. My experience ranges from kernel-level performance tooling in **C/C++** to full-stack and Android applications using **Java, Kotlin, React, and Node.js**.

Previously, I interned at **Qualcomm**, where I worked on performance-critical systems software and gained hands-on experience with low-level debugging, concurrency, and optimization. Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring, building side projects, and diving deeper into how real-world systems work.

**Tech I work with:**
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, Kotlin  
- **Frameworks:** Android (Jetpack Compose), React, Node.js  
- **Systems & Tools:** Linux, Git, WinDbg, CI/CD
